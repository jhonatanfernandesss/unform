## Migrating from 1.x

If you're still using Unform in any version below 2.0.0, we highly recommend you
follow this guide.

### Package name

Unform 2.0 added support for React Native and we moved our codebase to a monorepo.
With this change, all packages were renamed.

```sh
yarn remove @rocketseat/unform
yarn add @unform/core @unform/web
```

- `@unform/core`: Core functionalities, needed in web and mobile;
- `@unform/web`: Web integration, used in ReactJS;
- `@unform/mobile`: Mobile integration, used in React Native;

<br />

Use the platform (web/mobile) package to import the `Form` component; you can
import all the other functionalities directly from `@unform/core`.

### Input components

Since Unform 2.0, the package **does not include input controls anymore**, so
you cannot import Input, Select, or any other input components from Unform library.

Now you need to create your input controls following the Recipes and Third-party
examples here in docs. Check the [Simple input](/recipes/simple-input) guide to
create your first input control.
