# Examples

This folder contains Unform examples for different types of components. All of
them were tested and may work properly. You can also customize them for your
needs, hiding labels, styling error messages, etc.

## Add an example

If you'd like to submit an example, make sure it hasn't been proposed yet. To get started,
create your new example on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), test it and make sure it works as expected. When it's ready, open a PR to add it on this folder (we recommend you create the example for both JavaScript and TypeScript, but that's not required).

Also, don't forget to add a Usage example and the component on the file. So it's super easy to test it out! If it's a React Native example, add an `rn-` prefix to it.
